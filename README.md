<!-- Write a to-do list for this public webpage as a list of tickable items -->
## To-do list
* Clean the landing page so that it only has some brief description for myself
* Make the about me page so that it has a comprehensive CV-style overview of my career to-date
* Clean the Projects page so that it has a nice overview of the projects without too much bullshit
* Add a papers site that will list my selection of my papers
* Try to make the header and the footer in a separate file so that they can be more easily linked from each sub-page
* try to add a simple project from one of the sites Chris mentioned
* see if you can remove the .html from the website preview
