## How to Run These Files

1. **Using Node.js** (if installed):
   ```bash
   node 01-variables-and-data-types.js
   ```

2. **Using a web browser**:
   - Create an HTML file and include the JavaScript file
   - Open the browser's developer console to see output

3. **In VS Code**:
   - Install the "Code Runner" extension
   - Right-click on any file and select "Run Code"

## Learning Path

Start with file 01 and work your way through to file 07. Each file contains:
- Clear explanations in comments
- Practical examples
- Console output to help you understand what's happening

## Practice Suggestions

After going through each file:
1. Modify the examples to experiment
2. Try to write similar code from scratch
3. Combine concepts from different files
4. Create your own small projects
